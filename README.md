# An-investigation-of-User-Engagement-in-a-Metaverse-Game-Axie-Infinity

This is a Data Visualization project as a coursework.

We dive into a metaverse game Axie Infinity and investigate and analyze the user engagement based upon interactive visualizations on social media data/player transaction records.

We crawled billions of twitter data relevant to Axie Infinity with twitter's scraper api and also accessed user transaction records.

Five interactive visualizations are designed to measure the user engagement level temporally and spatially.
